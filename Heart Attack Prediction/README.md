Coranary atery disease EDA and prediction

In this repository Binary Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines was used to predict coronary artery disease in patients using SkiKit-Learn in Python. The 13 independent variables of this dataset are documented in addition to the response/outcome variables in the Jupyter Notebook

In this repository the following files are found;
- processed.cleveland.data - The raw data used as part of this data analysis from UCI
- heart_clean.csv – The cleaned data used for data visualisation
- heart_prediction.csv - The cleaned data used for prediction
- Heart_Attack_Prediction.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook of initial data cleaning, EDA and logistic regression/SVM of the dataset.
- Heart_Attack_Prediction.html – A HTML file of the above Jupyter Notebook.
- README.md – a README file of this repository
