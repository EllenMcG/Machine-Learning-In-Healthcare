**Binary Logistic Regression for Diabetes Prediction**

In this repository Binary Logistic Regression was used to predict diabetes in patients who are pregnant (Pima Indians Diabetes Database collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) using SkiKit-Learn in Python. The 8 independent variables of this dataset are documented in addition to the response/outcome variable below;

In this repository the following files are found;
- StatsProject_EllenMcGrory.docx – A Word file showing background of regression, assumptions of logistic regression, dataset used, and optimisation of logistic regression through hyperparameter tuning. This was written in assessment format so that I could understand more of the theory of logistic regression. 
- StatsProject_EllenMcGrory.pdf – A PDF file of the above Word document.
- diabetes.csv – The raw data used as part of this exploration of how logistic regression works.
- diabetes_clean_03042021.csv – The cleaned data used for data visualisation and logistic regression 
- LogisticFunction.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook of plotting a logistic function (this was used in Figure 1 of the written document)
- LogisticFunction.html – A HTML file of the above Jupyter Notebook.
- LogisticFunctionData.csv - raw data used for creating logistic function in LogisticFunction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
- Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression Updated 05042021 Hyperparameters.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook of initial data cleaning, EDA and logistic regression of the dataset.
- Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression Updated 05042021 Hyperparameters.html – A HTML file of the above Jupyter Notebook.
- README.md – a README file of this repository
